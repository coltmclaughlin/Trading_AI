Let's analyze each chart to help you make an informed decision.\\n\\nStarting with the daily chart, we can see that the overall trendline for the whole candles is bearish confident. Additionally, there is a straight line indicating the trend for the past 21 candles. The daily signal confirms a bearish sentiment, suggesting a selling zone from 158.654 to 159.1375. The target-profit zone for this trade is from 157.6185 to 157.135.\\n\\nMoving on to the weekly chart, we observe a similar bearish sentiment. The overall trendline for the whole candles is bearish confident, and the straight line represents the trend for the past 21 candles. The weekly signal aligns with the daily signal, indicating a bearish outlook. The selling zone for this timeframe is from 156.23366 to 156.783, while the target-profit zone is from 154.421 to 153.87166.\\n\\nLastly, on the monthly chart, we see a different trend. The overall trendline for the whole candles is Bullish Conservative, suggesting a potential reversal or upward movement. However, it is important to note that the straight line for the past 21 candles is not available on this chart. The monthly signal indicates a Bullish Conservative sentiment. The buying zone is from 153.95299 to 155.31633, while the target-profit zone is from 160.6 to 161.96333.\\n\\nBased on these three charts, the daily and weekly signals are both bearish confident, indicating a potential selling opportunity. However, the monthly signal suggests a Bullish Conservative sentiment, pointing towards a buying opportunity.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that trading decisions should not rely solely on technical indicators and trendlines. Fundamental analysis and market conditions should also be considered before executing any trades.\\n\\nI hope this analysis helps you in making your trading decision. If you have any further questions, please let me know.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nAiden-Tradeplans.ai\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False)"
